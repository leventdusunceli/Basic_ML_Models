As a part of the finishing project for Introduction to Machine Learning Techniques (IMLT) class, we were tasked with finding a good classification algorithm for a curated version of Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.  

More information about the dataset can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic) 



Our project has 3 main parts: 
1. Data Preprocessing 
2. Algorithm Optimization 
3. Feature Importance Evaluation 


At the end of the project, we include a brief literature review comparing our best performing algorithm with the currently available literature on prognostic factors of breast cancer
